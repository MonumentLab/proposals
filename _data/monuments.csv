The footprint of the arch site is small enough to allow for construction around it, when that day comes. Overlaying the arch opens up new ideas in 21st century monument making. Ideas include: colorful ceramic tiles and the use of the state's sea; special lighting effects; sculpted art depictions as seen on the walls of the Museum of the Revolutionary; and much more - for this is a monument where art and architecture would truly work together.
Unlike war memorials, the Keystone State Arch is not about somberness, but rather celebration. Its location is viewed by thousands of visitors daily, and is sure to be a tourist stop and contribute to a new waterfront identity. Funding can come from a multitude of private and public resources, even including souvenirs.
Out of town planners may not give a damn about defining this stat's rich historical heritage with our own Arc de Triomphe, where Penn's vision was born, but some us do. This Monument Lab will be our last chance to have a monument at Penn's Landing worth of this great space. Once the nearly fifty foot concrete skeletal stfucture is torn down, this promising icon - worth of a world of tourists - will be lost forever. Don't let it happen.
Add your voice, your art, your texting fingers, your joy at seeing this great arch welcome you to Penn's Landing, even as it welcomes you now. For this memorial arch is long overdue; think of the Gateway in St. Louis, or even the Statue of Liberty in New York. Let us honor the dead as we create this lasting tribute and invest in the future of our great Delaware River waterfront.","Architecture,History","0, 0, 0, 0, 0","Infrastructure,Mural,Space",,Mitchell Gordon,,,

*The space should include:*
-pillows for lounging on/making forts; outdoor fabrics, can have fun shapes like pretzels, liberty bell; bright colors
-A roof or partial roof (open sides)
-space for displaying art/photos. perhaps a slideshow + projector, perhaps a communal chalk board
-a drinking water tap

Do people understand that monuments (statues) were erected in memory/honor of people who were important at that time? Do people understand the history that elevated people to a place where some felt a monument necessary?
My problem is not with monuments but with our failure to adequately teach the history surrounding a monument, to learn from that history and for individuals to emulate the qualities that allowed those individuals to rise up. Why have monuments if we fail to teach their significance? Or fail to apply lessons learned to our current knowledge to make a better history for us all.

The Declaration of Independence was the touchstone of that promise, but its true legacy can be found in the continual exercise of democracy, self-correction, and progress that exists within American society.

As the museum expanding into the space the library can expand as well.  The Rizzo statue could move to this new museum.

I have lived and still do live along the Delaware River for all these years. I could have actually walked to the river but drove past it on Delaware/Columbus Avenues and crossed it for pretty much 4 decades over the Walt, Ben, and Betsey predominantly going to work in NJ but also on Sundays going to my 4 favorite farmers for veggies when they were open for the season.

I'm very, very, very newly retired. I have newly discovered both the Delaware in a ver different sense and rediscovered the Center City where I went to High School, University City where I went to College and some Post-Grad and North Philly where I did some Post-Grad.

Among the asphalt, concrete, high rise towers, busses, etc., and the hordes of people, I would nominate something that can reconnect us to nature. The river itself has a nature that's there but that we may not see. The river can be placid and silken, it can look like there are diamonds on the water, it can seem to flow North or South depending on the winds, sometimes there are whitecaps. Sometimes the color changes right before your eyes depending on depth. It all depends on what Mother Nature decides.

But Mother Nature also sends ducks, geese, sparrows, wrens, pigeons, crows, seagulls, an occasional hawk, and squirrels (who may be demanding). But isn't that's what we're here for. To not forget the connection.",Environment,0,Conceptual,"deleware, river, nature",Janice Cieslielski,,,

Colorful LED lights are embedded all over it. Close to its base are 5 hand cranks of different sizes - some at heights children can use - and easy to turn. As you turn one, some of the lights begin to flicker on.
As the second one is turned, more lights are activated. As each additional crank is turned still more lights come alive - in patterns that multiply their playful effects.
When all 5 are being cranked, the total effect is particularly dramatic, variable, and exuberant. Examples (on the sphere) might be: an image of a turning globe, floating clouds, a waving flag, brilliant //fireworks//, or crazy curlicues. Once activated, it all stays lighted up for a few minutes.
It takes everyone, acting together, to ignite something spectacular.
