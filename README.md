### Monument Lab 2017 Research Theme

![monument lab logo](https://github.com/bulbil/monumentlab/raw/master/assets/ml-logo.png)

A Jekyll theme based on the (amazing) static collections project [Minicomp/Wax](https://github.com/minicomp/wax/).

Building off theme, this fork does not serve IIIF resources and is "optimized" (used very loosely) for very large collections that include spatial metadata:

- Customized display meta display fields
- Endpoints for assets
- For non-IIIF assets
- [D3](https://d3js.org) gallery for *many* items in a collection with zoom/pan/filtering
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/map) map for navigating items in the collection with clustering/filtering
- Customizable filtering sidebar menu for map and gallery views
