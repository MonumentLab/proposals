proposal_transcription: move it to a remote place in West Fairmount Park where the
  monument //Colored Soldiers and Sailors of all wars// was hidden for 60 years (1936-1996).
  It would be appropriate for Rizzo to be there for 60 years. then another public
  discussion could take place. The //Colored Soldiers and Sailors// monument is now
  prominently located on Ben Franklin Parkway, a permanent installation I hope, but
  who knows, maybe a time will come when statues glorifying wars will all be moved
  to places less visible.
