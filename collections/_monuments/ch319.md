proposal_transcription: My thought is to add to current monuments that may be controversial.
  Add a small script which touches on both the positive controversial aspects of the
  peron. Making some one out to be a saint when they, like most, have made some pretty
  bad decisions can be hurtfull to those impacted. Including some bad acknowledges
  the wrongs that hopefully that person had attempted to correct before death.
