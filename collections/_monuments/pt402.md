proposal_transcription: A maze with opaque walls and photographs of random Philadelphians
  each next to a mirror. You look at the photograph, which is just a face, and then
  make a judgment about them based on what you see. Beneath the mirror is a panel
  which you open after contemplating the face. The panel contains a biographical narrative
  about the person. The exercise, if properly executed, should provide for self-reflection
  about judgments you have about other people bases solely on appearances
