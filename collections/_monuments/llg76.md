proposal_transcription: In the wake of gentrification and the //hipster revolution,
  // hundreds of residents have been displaced. This wave of wealthy investors and
  even well meaning business owners has created a deeper divide between the predominantly
  racially segregated communities. The image of the bodega, however, represents an
  example of a business that brings communities together.
