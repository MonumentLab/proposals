proposal_transcription: A playground or series of playgrounds that feature play equipment
  for children of all ages 0-100+. In addition all the equipment would produce energy
  to help power playground lights and nearby homes - similar to the ideas of Andrew
  Simoeni, Joel Lim, and Funfere Koroye. This would allow adults to play more closely
  with kids and make everyone more responsible in providing for their own energy needs.
