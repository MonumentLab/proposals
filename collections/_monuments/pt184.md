proposal_transcription: The monument would be a young child (6-10) sitting innocently
  on the ground on the ground while the world moves quickly around it. This would
  symbolize the thousands of kids involved in the child welfare system here in Philly,
  who are constantly having to sit and watch the world fall around them. W/ minimal
  funding, overworked case workers...more attention ($$) should go to helping the
  kids.
