  I personally feel like those kids that ride around the city on bikes, popping wheelies in traffic, deserve a monument. A statue. To me, they are an impediment of Philly culture.
  Many people may think of them as a nuisance but to me they are skilled and I'm alway happy to see young kids of color changing their energy into something cool. I envision a bronze statue of a group pf those kids, created in their name.
