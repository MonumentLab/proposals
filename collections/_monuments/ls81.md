proposal_transcription: |-
  a monument to women as caregivers of children, parents (elderly), and families. It should speak to the importance of the care of young children during The early years while growing up.
  Maybe be a massive, but beautiful figure of a woman with child, baby, young children around, elderly woman ..... etc.
  It could also be more __ not massive to involve many figures.
