proposal_transcription: One in every 8 visitors to R-house park comes in with one
  or more dogs in tow, but there's no place neat by for dogs, to really play. Sometimes
  people will drop their leashes so their dogs can run around, but it's dangerous.
  I've seen dogs run into the street. Putting up even a small fenced area devoted
  to the neighborhood dogs would transform the neighborhood and really go a long way
  to improving the neighborhood.
