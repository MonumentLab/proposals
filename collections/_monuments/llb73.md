  [Figure to the Left] Face of kindness as if to say //It's alright. Let me help you back up//.
  [Figure to the Right] Face of surprise. Has fallen. His knees are scratched, palms cut. Another figure approaches, offers a hand to help him on his feet. The good samaritan has his arms outstretched in an open act of kindness.
