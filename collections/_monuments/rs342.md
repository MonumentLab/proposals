proposal_transcription: Pay respect and promote the speech //Acres of Diamonds// by
  Russell Conwell, founder of Temple University.  The speech is a huge inspiration
  to me.  It's about (to me) how we have the talent and tenacity in this city to create
  enterprise and beauty in our own backyard.
