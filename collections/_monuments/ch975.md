proposal_transcription: |-
  At spruce street harbor park, there is currently a giant monument to Columbus describing him as a //brave, charismatic leader.// -- obviously, this is far from the truth.  I would have people project words that should actually be used to describe him like //killer, greedy, etc.// I would also project on the other 3 sides of the monument native american stories that have been lost from textbooks.

  side 1: projected words
  side 2-4: indigenous stories.
