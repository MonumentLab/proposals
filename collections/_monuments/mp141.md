proposal_transcription: I would like to see a monument depicting the variety of faces
  from different refugee, immigrant roups that make up this diverse city. Perhaps
  a depiction of a group over a dinner table, with each unique person bringing a cultural
  dish that represents their culture. Smiles and laughter should tell the message
  of how we all can learn and grow from our differences and how our city is better
  with diversity.
