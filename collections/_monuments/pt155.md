  feel safe and don't feel threatened. Somewhere where they can feel like they can
  be themselves and can spread positivity and peace. Also some paintings/sculptures
  that represent pride and saying it's OKAY to be yourself. Any race, sex, ethnicity,
  age, etc. is welcome. People can share their stories etc.
