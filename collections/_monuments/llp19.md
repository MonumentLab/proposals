proposal_transcription: Two children holding hands and standing in a circle and smiling.  One
  child one color - another a different color to show that everyone is equal.  One
  of the children is a little crumbled to represent crumbling child monument, the
  other child not crumbled.  The child that is crumbled has patches o make it look
  like it's fixed.  Gender neutral to represent everyone.   Sticks and stones around
  children to represent that it is easy to hurt friends.  Sticks and stones lay at
  the feet of the children.
