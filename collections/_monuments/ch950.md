proposal_transcription: my idea is a 5 ft tall x 4 fit wide stainless steel easel
  with 3 ft tripod legs. On the easal would sit a 3 ft x 2 1/5 foot notebook that
  anybody can open and write either a poem, phase, thought, recipe, song, or even
  draw a picture, whatever they wish to express. It would be my wish that the notebook
  would be put on display would be put on display at local libraries for all to see
  once the pages are full, and replaced with a fresh notebook.
