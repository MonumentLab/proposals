proposal_transcription: I think a monument to Dian Fossey and her work would be valuble.
  Dian Fossey was an American conservationist who did a lot of work with Gorillas.
  She was trying to reduce pouching. She was killed in her sleep by poachers one night
  while researching in Rwanda. There aren't many monuments of women or zoologists
  in Philadelphia and she made a lot of strides in research that a lot of times go
  unoticed.
