  What does this city mean to you?

  A blank wall with markers/paint and this question. People can come up and write/draw as they wish. Each day, the wall is refreshed to be blank again. At the end of each day it's filled with the creative inputs/thoughts/musings/feelings/ideas of Philadelphians. It's a place where people gather, talk reflect, and create.
