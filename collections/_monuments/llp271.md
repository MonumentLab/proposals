  a bunch of fist in the air. This symbolizes us as friends & family we all are in this together and we all have to be in this together to make the world a better place. Community a time to live we all have to be together and fight for what's right for us as a city, state, world environment, etc; Also for all the protests we have created and became successful with or maybe just made people open their eyes and see what's wrong with the world. And change people's mind on things
