proposal_transcription: Several bridges (5 or 7) of different designs and materials
  that are placed over and across one another. They invite passerby to walk over them
  and entice them to cross evert bridge. Some may have cracks or openings that you
  need to step over to get to the other side. The scale is large enough for the people
  to walk on.
