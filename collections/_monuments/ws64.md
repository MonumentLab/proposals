  I feel during a time where many different factors are dividing our nation, that a monument bringing unity to the city would be amazing to see. This should be something that makes everyone feel included and part of a more unified time in history. I think a monument that resembles puzzle pieces coming together that could signify that. Philadelphia and America would not be where it is today without strong ideas of unity and we need to get back to roots and morals designed for supporting one another regardless of race, sex, sexual orientation, economic status, etc.
  (sorry, I got lazy drawing the puzzle pieces)
  (plus Philly is on the rise and building and exploding as a city)...building blocks idea?
  (Anyways...we can use a word like UNITY or TOGETHER or any other word that draws attention to supporting one another)
