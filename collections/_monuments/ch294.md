proposal_transcription: |-
  I can't draw - But develop a walking memorial begin w/ the discovery by W. Penn & take it to the present & leave room to add for the future. It could be a mixture of historical, Ethnic & Religions events & items that represent the Phil. Area
  Could be a unifying monument.
