  Philly isn't always represented as a nice place, but for me & many others it's home. I want a monument to Philly as home that doubles as no commercial relaxation space and rain/sun shelter in Center City. Homeless people should also be welcome, as long sa they're sharing space w/ other visitors. (This fantasy space includes a budget for maintenance + a peace keeper/facilitator to keep anyone from hogging it.)
  *The space should include:*
  -pillows for lounging on/making forts; outdoor fabrics, can have fun shapes like pretzels, liberty bell; bright colors
  -A roof or partial roof (open sides)
  -space for displaying art/photos. perhaps a slideshow + projector, perhaps a communal chalk board
  -a drinking water tap
  -space for passerby to share copies of their favorite recipes + read others'
  Basically, I want a giant play kitchen that adults can also play in + pillows
  *potential collab. w/ organizations like Vetri Community Partners & their mobile teaching kitchen
