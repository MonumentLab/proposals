proposal_transcription: The monument would  be a Monopoly game - with the approx.
  1/2 played (most places bought).  The visitors are then told to join the game...and
  win.  The goal is to demonstrate that equality (everyone joining w/the same $) does
  not equal the same ability to win the game.
