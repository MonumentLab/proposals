proposal_transcription: Being the worst mass murder in Philadelphia’s history. The
  victims and their families should at least be giving a way to celebrate/acknowledge
  the loss.  There are people who will like to show their concern and support to the
  victim’s family and come together to reminisce about their loss loved ones.  Having
  a memorial every year will give us that platform and a wall that was once up will
  keep them alive because their lives are more important than new buildings being
  built to basically cover up what’s real.
