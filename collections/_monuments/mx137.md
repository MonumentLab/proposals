proposal_transcription: In my city of Philadelphia I would like to see more free parks
  that are staffed and have open and closed hours. The reason why I feel that it is
  important to have supervised parks is because over aged children and adults come
  to the free parks and litter or hang around using nasty language and drugs. It would
  be great to have these parks in honor of Obama.
