proposal_transcription: I would make a monument of the classic Jordan 8 's.  In today's
  society having good sneakers can make someone look at you differently.  Some younger
  kids can bust on you for not having good sneakers.  Therefore a monument of the
  classic bred Jordan 8's will make a huge statement.  It will represent how sneakers
  are on of the strongest development in apparel.
