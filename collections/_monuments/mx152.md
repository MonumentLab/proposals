proposal_transcription: In other countries there are monuments celebrating independence.
  Many at our monuments were put up to placate white ppl of the south. They don't
  celebrate independence, but slavery and bondage. Philly is a historic city in many
  different aspects. Monuments here should celebrate freedom and promote unity, while
  also acknowledging the fight that is continuing to be waged.
