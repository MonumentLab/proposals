proposal_transcription: |-
  1) For the //me// pedestool, maybe put it in Fairmount Park, to better blend the ramp in with earthworks, or attach a lift to the rear (allowing it to be placed anywhere)
  2) A //Students-->Future// monument at the entrance to University City or at the meeting point of Drexel and Penn (acknowledge temple and others in some way)
  3) A bronzed ballot box (large) either at independence hall or city hall
  4) Seasonal monument (shifts modularly 4 times a //year//, should reflect somethings Philly is famous for during each season)
  Had more ideas, ran out of space. I think usable (benches, table, maybe even plugs/charging stations) parks should be incorporated into the monuments/projects to increase their effectiveness in their communities
