proposal_transcription: Country/nation is divided in a destructive manner. We fail
  to bridge our differences and understand each other. My monument will be a model
  of independence hall, instead of bricks, made of glass and iron to indicate that
  we are in 2017. The hall is torn apart into two parts. One each side, there are
  some stars and bars as well, our new flag is divided. some states go to one side
  some to the other. I will put in front of independence hall to make us feel ashamed.
