proposal_transcription: Ben+I never thought we'd fall in love, but a lot of little
  things happened, out of our control, for us to meet and have the love we have today.
  We'd love to see a monument(s) that represents the //little things// in life and
  how it makes something far greater. Each monument would be scattered in popular
  areas around the city, like Rittenhouse Square, Old City, etc., and the monument(s)
  would be this tiny petal (different flowers in each location) with a large sign
  saying //All the little things lead to what we have here.// From above on a map,
  you'd see all the flowers' locations make a flower.
