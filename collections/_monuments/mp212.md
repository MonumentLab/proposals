proposal_transcription: Coltrane is the God of the saxophone. Yet his S.M. house is
  in shambles (along w/ the rest of the 'hood...). Dizzy transformed the trumpet &'ran'
  for pres. & he's a Philly boy? How do we honor these world changing & super-spiritual
  figures in their old home, Philly? I'd feel better knowing they watched over and
  blessed our city.
