proposal_transcription: On December 28, 2000, the biggest and the worst mass murder
  took place in Phila., Pa. on Lex St., Mill Creek Section in West Philadelphia.  This
  tragedy destroyed so many families and the community. The victims and their families
  should never be forgotten about. 10 shot and 7 dead.  In 2001 a mural was put up
  in remembrance of our loved ones but was removed within 2 years.  December 28, 2000
  should be remembered as a day of peace.  Al lives matter.
