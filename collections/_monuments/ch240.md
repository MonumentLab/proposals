proposal_transcription: Markers, dispersed around the city, that identify places where
  life-changing things happened to ppl - baby born, first kiss, arrival to US, drug
  overdose, shooting, etc. To bring out the resonances that ppl feel when they pass
  that special, marked space, to make the invisible passions + pains visible to others
  who share/walk through that same space.
