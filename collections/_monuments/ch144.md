  It [Waikiki Natatorium] is a swimming pool for the community - all can use it. It's the early WWI monument that isn't a guy on a horse. It's useful - community comes together in it - literally. Built in 1922 Duke Kahanamoku, Buster Crabbe, +Johnny Weissmuller worked out there, getting ready for the Olympics.
  Please do something that all can USE and enjoy.
