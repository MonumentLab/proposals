proposal_transcription: My monument represents that who ever you see in the mirror
  is who is the best and the person who's the best is you.  Your the est person you
  can possibly be so be yourself - there is no one better.  So Dream big and keep
  dreaming.  The monument is a mirror with //What do you see?// on top and //Your
  the best!// on bottom.
