proposal_transcription: As the sister of victim George Sig Porter from the Lex St.
  Massacre, I would love to see our mural of our loved ones mural on the grounds where
  it was since after 17 years there is still space to place it.  Philadelphia has
  paid more attention to the offenders or the Lucien Blackwell homes more than victims
  or our families & friends.  Lex street destroyed so many lives. I'm asking for help
  from the City of Philadelphia to help me heal and a whole community.  The city messed
  up the case so badly they had to bite the bullet which only made us suffer more.  We
  need a place to mourn and get together. We deserve a candle light vigil and memorial
  every year on December 28th
