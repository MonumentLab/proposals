proposal_transcription: People feed squirrels too much - they're fat + unruly! Make
  loving, friendly animatronic squirrels and let them loose in the park. They would
  be lifelike and take tons of food that real squirrels don't need. They would use
  this as biofuel and turn it into energy in their animatronic guts. They would unload
  this power into a charging station in the Square, where people can charge their
  phones in order to take more pictures of these stupid squirrels. The millennial
  circle of life is complete.
