  I'm not a very visual person, so its hard to discribe visually how the monument should look. But here are some thoughts...
  recently, I've found it difficult to have serious and impactful conversations about change and what our city needs to do to move forward. I wish for Philadelphia that we can become more thoughtful listeners. Everyone feels hurt, and misunderstood to a level where they aren't listening to solutions or wanting to move forward productively. Maybe this monument can serve as a call to action or an explanation of the complexity of today's dialogues.
