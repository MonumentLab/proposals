  Sculpture is expensive. Every other city has it too.

  Rodin is here.
  - Philly should employ ($)
  some local artists, residents and students, to paint a few, iconically related
  murals. (few words)
  This is a cheap project.
  -Only labor, paint, and
  some protection / maintenance.
  - THEMES broadly related to
  Philly / PA / metro
  -for adults-

  (not stupid kids tutorials)
