proposal_transcription: This telescope/looking glass presents an opportunity for the
  outside world to look in on the great culture and history of Philadelphia. The monument
  also serves as a form of self reflection since the //lens// of the telescope is
  a mirror reflecting the image of native residents. This self reflection is a chance
  for Philadelphians to self evaluate and decide themselves how they want the world
  to view them.
