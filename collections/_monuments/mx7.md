proposal_transcription: I think Paul Robeson deserves another monument. I know there
  are some great murals of him around, but it couldn't hurt to honor him in other
  ways. He lived a remarkable life as an artist, actor, and athlete, and made a lot
  of really important political stands against racism, fascism, and capitalism in
  the face of all kinds of pressure. He would be a great person to honor as a former
  resident of Philadelphia and a role model for today !
