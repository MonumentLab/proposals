proposal_transcription: It’s been 17 years since the Lex St tragedy and it’s well
  over due for some type of recognition for the victims and their families.  Every
  year the media speaks on how there are new homes and show pictures of the old homes
  but speak little to nothing on how it came about and how it effected people.  The
  7 young men that loss their lives that night of Dec. 28th 2000 were more than just
  of that of Lex St and the city should acknowledge that.  A wall was made before
  the homes were blown away to honor and show respect to the young men that passed
  away to give their families something to remind them and assure them that their
  lives matter and they will forever be remembered for more than just Lex St. A memorial
  can the wall should be giving to the victims and their families.
