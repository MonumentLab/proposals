proposal_transcription: As a young teen we went swimming at a place we called bare-ass
  beach. It was a black sand covered area with a large tess on pole at the end of
  the beach. We swam naked in the water and it was such a great place to swim. This
  dates back to 1967-1969 when the ships passed, they caused a great surge in the
  waves. After our swim we would get washed off at a water pipe at Perenstein Glass
  Co. where we would wash off. Great memories.
