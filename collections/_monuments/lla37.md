proposal_transcription: I would like to see a monument on the waterfront to the transatlantic
  slave trade. I have heard that the Pier at Market St. was one of the busiest ports
  on the route. Some sort of acknowledgment to the men, women and children that entered
  this country in darkness by force. Some monument to people of color and their history
  and heritage.
