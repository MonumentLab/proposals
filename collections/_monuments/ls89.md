proposal_transcription: The liberty bell is a monument that I want to honor. It speaks
  to the truth of people, and our acceptance of others. It gives people a reminder
  that all freedom is for everybody; don't take it for granted. I would honor it  instead
  of creating a new monument. I love this city because of our amazing museums and
  poems on art.
