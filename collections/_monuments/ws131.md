proposal_transcription: Photographs taken of architectural elements/details, taken
  in various areas of Philadelphia, displayed throughout the public space. The concept
  would be to encourage others to take the time during their day to actually look
  up and observe buildings that they pass by every day but don't pay attention, therefore
  transitioning the mundane into something beautiful. The images would be of varying
  scales of the architecture, some more representative, some more abstracted.
