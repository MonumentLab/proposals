  100% access to both the Delaware River and the Schuylkill River-- continual walkways well lit, w/ seating, bathroom facilities, etc so that all have access + can spend extended time, with changing art installations by local artists.

  We experience our city in totality from the water perspective of the river walls vistas - these walkways will be where all in the city meet.
