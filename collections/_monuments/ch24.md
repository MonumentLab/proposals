proposal_transcription: I heard that Lancaster Ave in West Philly was a Native American
  route that tribes took to get to tribal conventions. I'm sure there are many other
  stories in the city that are site-specific that remind us that we are living on
  stolen land. We must revisit this history & revise Native American narrative of
  our city!
