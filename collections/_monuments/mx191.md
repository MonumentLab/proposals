proposal_transcription: We have a plethora of Bronze Monuments Dedicated to dead white
  guys. Time to have a Monument to show that Philadelphia owes it's existence to role
  models of all colors, genders and religions. Example, Malcolm X, Caroline LeCount,
  Cecil B. Moore, & Marcus Foster. Good Luck!
