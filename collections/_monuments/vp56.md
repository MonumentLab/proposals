proposal_transcription: A map of Philadelphia's 7th Ward as it was in 1896 when W.E.B
  DuBois was commissioned by U. Penn to do research on the black population in Philadelphia.  A
  brief summary of the state of black America and his analysis can be provided and
  maybe even a contrast of black Philadelphias today.  I can help w/ that btw :)
