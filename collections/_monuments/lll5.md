  (1) Each year, EVERYONE in Philly is invited to parade through the streets, dressed as people who have helped our city march forward:

  (2) They can dress as past figures/leaders (Ben Franklin, Marcus Garvey, Octavius Catto, Mayor Kenny), or as themselves (the leaders of the future)

  (3) On the roads will be printed dates of achievements (civil rights bills, suffrage, etc.)
