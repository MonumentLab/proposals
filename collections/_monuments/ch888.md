  It is a Liberty Bell 2017 - cracked open with the Truths of Liberty and Freedom emerging. I'd make the crack bordered by tracks - like a Literal //Underground Railroad//. Though it's out in the open now, where today people travel to freedom in the U.S. (supposedly). You could carve/etch discernable ethnic faces all along the crack or have figures emerging.

  (Ignore the //sketch// - I can't really draw it - but there's the idea...)
