proposal_transcription: Envision a statue of Julian Abele, Architect of the Phila
  Museum of Art. I feel he deserves more than a historical marker. It's a shame to
  have statue of Rocky, a fictitious boxer & ignore the True History & Beauty of this
  Building. If Rocky thought it important enough to go from inspiration. WHY NOT US?
