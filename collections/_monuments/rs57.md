proposal_transcription: Joe Frazier was a boer from Philadelphia. He won many titles
  in Heavy Weight and brought revenues to the City. However, the City of Phila has
  no monument representing this great man. I believe that Joe Frazier should have
  monument located in a area of tourism to thank for his career accomplishments.
