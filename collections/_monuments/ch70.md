proposal_transcription: Philadelphia is a place of firsts - First destination for
  many settlers from Ireland, First constitution, first declaration of independence,
  first public hospital, first Bethel church, first American flag made etc. It must
  have the world record for 1sts, so I propose either a Gold/Brass Figure 1 or a gold
  record with Philadelphia cheese logo as the record label
