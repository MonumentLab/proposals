  Message to the mayor!
  Could you remove the car auction lot and reclaim it for the people. Expand Polaski Pier Park! Return the waterfront to the people that want to use it for recreational/community space, making it an exceptional park that extends to the next pier!!! Many of these businesses don' need to be by the water!!!!???!!!
