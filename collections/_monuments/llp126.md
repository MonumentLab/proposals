proposal_transcription: This represents brotherly love in Philadelphia. This shows
  that Philadelphia welcomes you to the city. The only problem with this is because
  it is brotherly love instead of sisterly love. I feel as if women are underestimated
  and that they should get treated like men are. It is sad how the world does not
  except women like they do men. I still like the statue, though. Also, the statue
  should come back to Love Park.
