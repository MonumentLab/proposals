proposal_transcription: I'm not sure what it would look like, but it would be a monument
  (or several?) of places which were //removed// by Urban Renewal programs. Some examples
  might include under Rt 95 along the Delaware, communities like //Black Bottom//
  (now the sites of Penn and big hospitals) which were bought up or forcibly removed.
  City Planning wasn't always so great-- and we need to think about //what are we
  removing today?//
