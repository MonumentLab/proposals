proposal_transcription: a quiet place - a place to prompt Philadelphians to sit in
  silence alone together, either for reflection, drawing, writing, reading, moving,
  etc. Social connection may be built outside or inside the space, but it's important
  that the place itself remain in silence. Not sure what it would look like.
