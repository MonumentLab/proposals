proposal_transcription: Philadelphia is home to two incredible dental schools - Penn
  and Temple, but yet according to SEPA in 2014, Philadelphia county has the highest
  % of children who did not see a dentist in the past year (15.3%). This monument
  serves as a visual public health reminder on the importance of oral care and our
  goal to increase access and awareness.
