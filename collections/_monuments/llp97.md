proposal_transcription: If everybody in the world didn't have skin, we will all look
  the same. So nobody can be rejected.  We all have exactly same blood, bone, and
  skin.  we are all the same so nobody should be treated different. So African American,
  Arabic, Muslim, any body - even girls - we should all be treated fairly.
