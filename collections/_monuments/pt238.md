proposal_transcription: It'd be great to have a climbing wall incorporated into the
  grove of tress between the park and raw old sugar refinery. It would encourage visitors
  to climb, gain new perspective; seek solace, build strength. Sometimes all it takes
  is a few vertical steps to put life into a completely new perspective.
