proposal_transcription: Right outside of city hall (skatepark area) there are lots
  of floor stickers/statements describing the struggles & legitimacy & importance
  of immigrants. In light of recent national events, a monument supporting the idea
  of Philadelphia being a home for all people, and the city standing behind these
  human beings would be very inspiring to see.
