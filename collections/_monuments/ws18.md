  I research trash. What it is, where it goes, and how it holds information specific to our contemporary culture.
  In the way that Charles Wilson Peale and 'natural philosophers' of their time categorized fuana & flora, placed in glass cases for public view. I would like to make plexiglass cases on Victorian pedestals with various groupings of trash items inside - Tide bottles, fabric softener bottles, beverage bottles, etc.  Giving written information about things like
  -impact on environments; disposal - proper & improper
  -origin of materials found in nature.
  -longevity of plastic trash and trash compacted in land fill.
  Also have cases with creative solutions to the problem of trash in the environment.
  These cases would be suitable for interior or exterior locations. I would like to see them near trash cans that are such a part of the park experience.
