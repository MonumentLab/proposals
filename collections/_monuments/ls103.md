proposal_transcription: A statue of Ms. Tubman depicting how she may have looked when
  she first arrived in Philadelphia, her first taste of freedom. She was taken in
  by Stephen Smith, who lived near 9th and Lombard. To award slave catchers, Smith
  took her to Cape May, where she worked and saved money for expectations back into
  Maryland to free her family. Also her work with the U.S. sanitary commission in
  Philadelphia should be honored.
