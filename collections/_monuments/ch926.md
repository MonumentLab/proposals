proposal_transcription: A digital monument to mark the location where Penn researchers
  invented ENIAC in 1946, the world's first modern computer I think. The building
  is also the site of the world's first computer science lectures. A plaque outside
  the building currently honors this but I feel this should be honored in a bigger
  way considering its importance.
