proposal_transcription: A bronze, larger-than-life-sized statue of the cast of FX's
  //It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia//, placed directly in a dumpster.  Too often
  are the denizens of our fine city equated with the garbage people portrayed on the
  hit sitcom.  Let us commemorate them in the trash where they belong.
