proposal_transcription: A metal compass sunk into the ground, with lines radiating
  out from it in the directions migrants to Philadelphia came from (or left for).
  Length of the line would represent the total number of migrants who come from or
  went in that direction. Blue would denote migrants in, and red migrants out.
