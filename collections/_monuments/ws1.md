  Incorporate the existing Rizzo statue into a grouping which includes (new) statues of Rendell, Nutter, + 3 //historical// mayors (maybe Dilworth + a couple from past centuries)*. Show them engaging with each other and/or the viewer in positive, welcoming, friendly postures.
  Make the grouping reflect as much diversity as possible (given the pool of //eligibles//), with a theme of uniting across the lines which sometimes seem to divide the city, and creating a space where all feel welcome.
  *e.g. include the mayor who had been a Union general whose statue was recently stolen
