proposal_transcription: A circular monument, a gentle bubbling fountain at the center,
  with thin planks of metal surrounding it. The planks are of varying heights, each
  depending on the number of people who have been diagnosed with HIV/AIDS in Philadelphia
  from 1980 to present. The highest spike curls down, withering under its own weight.
  On the inside, the names of those who have been diagnosed are etched onto the inner
  side, something one can only see in looking through the gaps.
