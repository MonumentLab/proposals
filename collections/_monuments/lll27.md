  a monument to commemorate the spirit of Philadelphia - for hundreds of years - to figuring out a better way, a new way, to work together for the common good.

  examples: Waterworks + Fairmount Park
  savings + loans
  Eastern State Penitentiary (groundbreaking at the time)
  The Library Company
  probably social innovations too, I'm less familiar with those.

  Many other places - and monuments - celebrate individual achievement.  Philadelphia is a place where people think about innovative new ways to work collectively to improve the lives of others and the community.
