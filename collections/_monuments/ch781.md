proposal_transcription: I'm a Jew from NYC. All of the Jewish museums in NYC are (almost)
  hidden away. But this museum - and the monument, dedicated by Jewish org.s - way
  one of the 1st things I saw here. Massive! Representation! Yes! There aren't enough
  loud proclamations by and for women, POC, immigrants, Jews, LGBT, etc. There needs
  to be more. Seeing this one made me feel something special the everyone should.
  Philly- and America - should belong to all of us.
