  Temple is Philadelphia's only public school. It was founded by Dr. Conwell in order to educate the working class. Public schools are one of our society's only means of lifting the working class and enriching our culture. Let's make a monument to what this man stood for - equal access across the board. At a time when college costs are skyrocketing. We as a society should let people of the future know that we stood for a culture based upon access to learning and FREE knowledge.
