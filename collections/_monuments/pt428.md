  I'm 65 years old. I have lived and still do live along the Delaware River for all these years. I could have actually walked to the river but drove past it on Delaware/Columbus Avenues and crossed it for pretty much 4 decades over the Walt, Ben, and Betsey predominantly going to work in NJ but also on Sundays going to my 4 favorite farmers for veggies when they were open for the season.

  I'm very, very, very newly retired. I have newly discovered both the Delaware in a ver different sense and rediscovered the Center City where I went to High School, University City where I went to College and some Post-Grad and North Philly where I did some Post-Grad.

  Among the asphalt, concrete, high rise towers, busses, etc., and the hordes of people, I would nominate something that can reconnect us to nature. The river itself has a nature that's there but that we may not see. The river can be placid and silken, it can look like there are diamonds on the water, it can seem to flow North or South depending on the winds, sometimes there are whitecaps. Sometimes the color changes right before your eyes depending on depth. It all depends on what Mother Nature decides.

  But Mother Nature also sends ducks, geese, sparrows, wrens, pigeons, crows, seagulls, an occasional hawk, and squirrels (who may be demanding). But isn't that's what we're here for. To not forget the connection.
