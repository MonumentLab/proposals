proposal_transcription: Because this town is sometimes called the city of brotherly
  love maybe where the LOVE park used to be there could be a projection of videos
  of people talking about fond memories they had in Philly/ things they love about
  Philly. Or the monument can be interactive and people can write things they like
  about Philly on paper and tie it to tree branches or maybe a wall can be painted
  with chalkboard paint and people can write on that wall with chalk
