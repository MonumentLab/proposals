  This monument wouldn't be for or of people, but of local animals like deer from the Wissahickan, fish from the Schuylkill, and maybe some sparrows. It wouldn't be on a pedestal, but the base would be like tall grass and the animals would look as if they were breathing. It would be colorful and abstract, much like the fish art project that is already going on in East Falls

  ALSO a beautiful information plaque at the schuylkill so people understand the water situation and be mindful of the pollution issue.
