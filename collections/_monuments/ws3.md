proposal_transcription: Felt //at ease// sitting on the stoop - there's a level of
  familiarity and informality with a dash of nostalgia - my first thought was that
  people sit on stoops in rowhome neighborhoods because there's nowhere else to sit,
  but then felt comfortable enough to stay for like 20 minutes. If a stoop itself
  is a monument it lifts up our value of community and connection as being worthy
  on a monumental level - that is nice.
