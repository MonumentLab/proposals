  Interrelation and interdependency of cultures and race.  Race & bias extend far beyond the issue of black & white.  Go beyond difference and recognize value of and necessity of our relationships in business, religion, education, commerce and personal relationships.

  Maybe a map.

  Maybe symbolism of a cut in link of interdependence

  A fence?

  Maybe a pixar video of what happens when you pull out one of the //cogs// in the wheel.
