  Mayor Frank Rizzo said, //It'sthe ugliest thing I ever saw, // so it's still my favorite.
  As Americans, we were wrong to a statue of Saddam Hussein in order to redefine and reshape our relationship with Iraq, and I wish we could reshape our own sense of ourselves with less violent iconoclasm and more intense self-examination. I write this while surrounded by large monuments with mixed origins and mixed meanings. Btw, I like to black power comb now standing near Rizzo's rather flattering statue.
