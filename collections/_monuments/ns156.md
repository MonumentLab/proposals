proposal_transcription: Noted African American artist Henry Ossawa Tanner lived in
  Strawberry Mansion and one day, his father took him on a ramble through E. Fairmount
  Park.  As they entered a point near the Shuylkill, they came upon a painter working
  al fresco.  Tanner says in his Autobiography that it was then that he realized what
  an artist was and he committed himself to becoming one.
