proposal_transcription: IDK what this monument would look like but I believe the true
  story should be told! 11 people were burned alive, 65 homes were burned down, some
  of the same houses are still bonded up. All because people of color had different
  views than others ... & the funny part is their same exact views they had is being
  pushed into society, eat my veggies. plating food, community living etc. There is
  one woman still alive from this situation ... find her !
