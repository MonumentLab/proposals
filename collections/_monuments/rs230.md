proposal_transcription: I'd really like to see a monument that represents the idea
  of //community// in Philly. I only just moved here a few weeks ago but I've been
  pleasantly surprised by how friendly the people are here. My idea is of a monument
  that's composed of a wide range of people from all diff. backgrounds. Maybe they're
  standing in a circle. Each one is doing something to help the next. Maybe one is
  holding an older neighbor steady himself before he falls another one is translating
  something (a sign?) for a new immigrant. It's the little things that matter, and
  I think Philly as the city of brotherly love could be represented by such a monument.
  Best, Joyce.
