proposal_transcription: In each neighborhood of Philly, residents will collect garbage
  on their streets. Trucks will bring that garbage to city hall, where a team will
  build a trash-mandala-replica of the Penn's Plan compass. Each neighborhood's trash
  will fill in a section of the compass, and over the course of a week the garbage
  will accumulate and pile high, documenting the scope and distribution of trash in
  the city. And then, we clean.
