proposal_transcription: I want to see a monument that is centrally located that reminds
  people of the power of art - that art is like oxygen - we need it for our survival
  as the human race. I see this as a beautiful map that mines the rich social imagery
  in our city - with strings of light that act as a great connector. at the heart
  of the map are the words Beauty, Resilience, Humanity Justice
