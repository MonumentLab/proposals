proposal_transcription: 'Take corner row house buildings that were once mom + pop
  stores  (bakeries, luncheonettes, barbers, etc-). These were important building
  blocks of community in Philly but they are fast disappearing (along w/ sense of
  community), victims of internet shopping, big box stores, planned activities for
  kids + many other factors. Turn these spaces into community spaces via activities
  + visually as each neighborhood desires. EG: Activities: music, games, sitting on
  stoops, homework help, etc. EG visual/historic: lawn chairs, neon signs, photos
  of neighborhood, soda fountains, sports memorabilia, street games painted on floor,
  etc.'
