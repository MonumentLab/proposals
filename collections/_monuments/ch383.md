proposal_transcription: I don't have any specific monument ideas, however, I think
  monuments should begin telling the whole truth of a person if it's a bust or statue.
  Tell if that person was good and bad and let the art speak for itself. If the person
  is flawed that's OK, Wall are flawed. It's time to see us get away from personal
  statues and more on monuments that depict the spirit or message of a person.
