  * A dance unique to Philadelphians*
  that all Philadelphians will know almost like a flashmob   it will unite any one in Philly with others i.e. if you travel to a different place and another Philly person recognizes it they can join in and encourage others to participate in the flash mob dance. Brings unity and brotherly love with Philly folks no matter what place they live in...
