proposal_transcription: A monument that creates a space where people enter and sit
  + talk without being able to see one another. Their conversations would be recorded
  + then played back in a separate space. The conversation would always be the same
  //what I want the world to be --my vision for a better world.// It is a monument
  to the present + future, to possibilities imaged + thoughts on how to make them
  happen.
