proposal_transcription: You are not one of many.  You are not separated from others.  You
  are not nothing.  Your freedom makes you alike with others.  We are all free.  Free
  from Britain, slavery, racists, segregation.  We took our rights.  Our independence.
  And our people.  We are all free.  Like all other whom are welcome. Welcome to the
  freedom of our people.  The Wall with people over it.
