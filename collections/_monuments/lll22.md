proposal_transcription: The goal of this monument would be to make an indelible statement
  about the vital role teachers play in supporting the well-being of our communities.  With
  all of the political disagreement over how to improve the quality of public education
  somehow the profession of teacher has been subject to a lot negative criticism and
  has lost some of its status as an essential component of healthy, thriving societies.  We
  should erect a monument that celebrates + honors all teachers and acknowledges that
  the future + fortunes of our children + our city will always be connected to the
  efforts + compassion of our teachers.  The statue could be of a teacher reading
  a book surrounded by young children.
