  but could others with important contributions
  We visit Italy a lot and I am always impressed by the number and beauty of artistic statues
  I am in front of Washington park and someone explained there are a number of pedestals to stimulate conversation. I think pedestals of the founding fathers and others who have made contributions to the country/city would be entertaining, educational, and artistically inspiring. I envision full length/full body statue all in marble/white
