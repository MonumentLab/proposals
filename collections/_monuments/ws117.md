  The pretzel ties our city together!
  Reflective pretzel monument reminiscent of Chicago's bean sculpture (Cloud Gate).
  Pretzel would float on an angle and people would be able to walk under it and enjoy it from all angles.
  There would also be a volunteer-run pretzel kitchen that would provide free pretzels for all.
