proposal_transcription: My monument is to honor my favorite 33 bus driver who was
  always super-patient with people and tried to remember all the regular riders. (She
  is probably still a bus driver but I think she changed routes.) It would be a statue
  of a bus w/ a driver in it that people could get inside
