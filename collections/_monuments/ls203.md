proposal_transcription: It would be a sculpture of two hands being raised, what people  usually
  do when they are about to get shot.  The hands could be any color but on the hands
  would be the names of every Philadelphian killed due to gun violence.  The names
  on the hands would be written in white for no specific reason.
