  Philly is but leaking exposer beeing surrounded by NY and Washington. How can you expose yourself between these two hubs and show more what you are capable of. I think this is something Philly struggles with.
  To show that a monument should focus on how to discover history, and maintain history, transform history and expose it. So at first you should focus on discovering yourself (like where is Walter Waldon) followed by describing and transforming how to change the exposure.
