proposal_transcription: Omar was a staple in the neighborhood who passed away recently.
  If you didn't know who he is, ask any business owner or resident at that intersection.
  They will tell you. He was a performance artist, clown, philosopher, watchman, and
  friend. He deserves to be commemorated w/ a statue or mural.
