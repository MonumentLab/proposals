proposal_transcription: The city of Philadelphia should have something that reflects
  what's unique about the city. More importantly, it should be something every should
  feel proud of. Philly is also a city that had so much history, liberty, and freedom.
  The monument should reflect the city's diversity and it's pursuit of equalness to
  all. Perhaps it can be a traditional scale, but with multiple //plates//, each with
  black, white, asian, women, etc.
