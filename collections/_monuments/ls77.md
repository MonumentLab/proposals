proposal_transcription: A grouping of fabricated Sam Maitin structures (colorful,
  3-dimensional, slightly larger than life-sized) that people can walk around among,
  kids can climb on, and all can enjoy. Beautiful plantings can go around the bases.
  To use color and organic form to bring joy to Philadelphia citizens and visitors.
  Could be in front of Moore College of Art where one was originally proposed and
  for which sketches exist.
