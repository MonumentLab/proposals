proposal_transcription: Instead of steps in Wash. Square (not in one same artistic
  register as the architecture of the area), move them to park at 3rd and 4th & Washington;
  in Wash Square, a monument made out of architectural details from beautiful Gilded
  Era buildings -- There is a TON of it that's scavenged or dragged to landfill, so
  sad. Be a beautiful monument!
