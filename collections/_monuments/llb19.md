proposal_transcription: Sculpture (brass) in front of or near the Coltrane House,
  thinking a bust of Coltrane similar to the one of Charlie Parker in Kansas City.
  Coltrane's face was so expressive. This would be to commemorate Coltrane's time
  in Philly, in the hopes of bringing more attention to his old house so that it can
  continue to be preserved. One of music's most creative figures can't be forgotten
  in the context of Philly's history. The Coltrane Fest is great, but his home (a
  historical landmark) needs more love and attention. I think a sculpture could be
  helpful and timeless.
