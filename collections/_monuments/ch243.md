proposal_transcription: William Penn signed a peace treaty with the native peoples
  of this area. Penn believed that everyone in Pennsylvania - even now Europeans,
  had the same civil rights. In fact, Penn's statue on City Hall faces Penn Treaty
  Park - not due east. If this type of statue/monument already exists, it should be
  duplicated elsewhere in Center City.
