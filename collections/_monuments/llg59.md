proposal_transcription: Re-do the iconic Philadelphia store front look. This includes
  the stoops, the pole, and the door. The corner store is truly a Philadelphian tradition
  and I'd love to see some of the ones that are out of commission redone, maybe even
  relocated to more iconic locations, like parks or public locations
