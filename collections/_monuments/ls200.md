proposal_transcription: Since Philly has such a large running community and more and
  more women are competing in sports everyday, I think it would be very motivational/inspirational
  to have a statue of a girl running near the Art Museum, maybe in the part across
  it, as majority of races end there.  I think the statue would further reflect Philly's
  diverse culture and growth and inspire young women like me!
