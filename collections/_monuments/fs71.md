  Something that preserves accurate historical representation. As everything else becomes corporatized/homogenized, real history will disappear.
  IMO those focused on tearing down monuments will be at the forefront of those 'doomed to repeat history' - as the quote famously states.
  I'm not an artists + my parking meter is about to expire. Thank you
