  A monument that celebrates the languages before colonizers conquered America. In response to the famous Philly cheesesteaks land marks and their signs stating //This is America, when ordering, speak English.// I want the monument to have passerbys
  -write poems -cheesesteak orders -responses in their languages in response to the sign.
  The monument could be a few of the tribes chiefs sitting together with cheesesteaks. Responses would be posted in between the fake metal cheesesteaks.
