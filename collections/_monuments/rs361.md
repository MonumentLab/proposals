proposal_transcription: |-
  *I think Philadelphia could consider creating a //centralized// monument that commemorates our best sports moments as a city.
  *This designation could be kind of like L.A.'s //walk of sidewalk stars// but represent Philadelphia's sports teams best moments/best players.
  *This //monument of athletic fame// could feature all/many of Philadelphia athletes and/or moments in sports history.
  *It should be placed somewhere not near to the stadiums, somewhere that is central to our city, however.  Open to the public 24/7.
