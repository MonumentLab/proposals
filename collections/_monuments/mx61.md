  Lucretia Mott was involved in the Abolitionist movement, fought for peace, Native American rights, and women's rights. She and her husband were involved in the underground railroad and founded the Female Antislavery Society (which allowed black members).
  There are not enough women/minority monuments in Philadelphia.
  I could not even begin to design this monument.
