proposal_transcription: This monument asks residents to chalk their sidewalks and
  streets with the names of who or what was there before them. Each neighborhood could
  do this, a different neighborhood each week. Names must be included, but sketches
  also would be welcome, and any info they could find about what the person did while
  they lived there and how they died (if deceased) .
