proposal_transcription: It's a statue of Elon Musk in the same position as the statue
  of liberty, but holding solar panels, providing energy. The energy can then be transferred
  to any thing that will provide a good symbiotic press relation. Like an orphanage,
  or a homeless shelter, or a failing, yet iconic Philly small business.
