proposal_transcription: I think monuments //should// help provide historical content
  for current concerns, high lighting important movements and milestones in our never
  ending project of building a more perfect union. They can be temporary. They can
  honor both individual and (more importantly) collective contributions to the common
  good . Ideally they would convey not mainly the stature of individuals but the nature
  of their gifts to society. Spirit of gratitude, even celebration.
