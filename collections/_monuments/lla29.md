proposal_transcription: Franklin Square fountain is retrofitted with a statue of a
  soda bottle with water spraying from the top and perhaps statues of happy children
  embracing the bottle. Children can swim and play in the fountain. City jail nearby
  at 7th/Arch is torn down and replaced with a free preschool.
