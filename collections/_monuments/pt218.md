proposal_transcription: I believe we need more timeless monuments in the city that
  do not involve politics and instead focus on the pillars of unity and love. The
  green connections and circle symbolize our connection the Earth and our community.
  The blue + red panels represent the many cultures and personalities that make up
  our city. The purple is the unity of everything that connects all people and places
  to each other.
