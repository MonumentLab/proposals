  This idea is for the existing main library at Vine St to be enlarged into an expanded Museum of Philadelphia History.  The existing collective of the current Philly City Museum would be moved there but expanding access to Philly history current in the library's collection of maps throughout Philly's past would be the main taking-off point. I can imagine 3D reality presentations based on old maps.  A guest might walk in a //holodeck// style of 1700's reality with fewer bldgs, etc.

  Philadelphia was the nations 1st capital city.  We don't see that well enough today or see what was here before that.

  As the museum expanding into the space the library can expand as well.  The Rizzo statue could move to this new museum.  The city would have a notably better role in telling the nation's history +the role + betrayal of native Americans could be presented in a way that would have a chance to occasion some healing.
