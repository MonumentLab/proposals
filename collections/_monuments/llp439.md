proposal_transcription: My monument would be anti-columbus and pro-indigenous peoples
  day. Some people on the other side of the country support Columbus Day, and he didn't
  really do anything that was helpful. He killed so many Native Americans because
  he was so greedy. This monument represents how the Native Americans are the founders
  of our country, not Columbus.
