  Just make a dog park...
  with statues of REAL DOGS that live in Philly and WE LOVE THEM. or the Bernese Mountain Dog on South Street who's owner's name is Andrew and who fell in love with me from across the street and all I really want is to feel like that dog when he ran across the street to meet me for the first time. like that little terrier/chiuahah on 4th & Pine... or the giant white Akita who lives in Manayunk. or Bob : the Elkhound who lives in the adoption center on 3rd.
