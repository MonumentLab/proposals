  I think we should place an 'ode to education' type monument.
  The monument would be a stack of enormous books, with one or two of them open, with readable pages. It would be cool if the material would be bronze, or another material that wears well.
  People could submit meaningful documents of the city or famous poets/writers could submit pieces to be displayed on the books.
  This way, the monument is an open, breathing dialogue that displays meaningful messages to Philadelphians.
