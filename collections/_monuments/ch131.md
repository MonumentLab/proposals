  The Keystone State Arch is a proposal to transform the colossal base of the former aerial tram project at Penn's Landing into a state memorial dedicated to the area where Pennsylvania took root. here we will honor the people who made the state great and who helped carry the nation to greatness.
  The footprint of the arch site is small enough to allow for construction around it, when that day comes. Overlaying the arch opens up new ideas in 21st century monument making. Ideas include: colorful ceramic tiles and the use of the state's sea; special lighting effects; sculpted art depictions as seen on the walls of the Museum of the Revolutionary; and much more - for this is a monument where art and architecture would truly work together.
  Unlike war memorials, the Keystone State Arch is not about somberness, but rather celebration. Its location is viewed by thousands of visitors daily, and is sure to be a tourist stop and contribute to a new waterfront identity. Funding can come from a multitude of private and public resources, even including souvenirs.
  Out of town planners may not give a damn about defining this stat's rich historical heritage with our own Arc de Triomphe, where Penn's vision was born, but some us do. This Monument Lab will be our last chance to have a monument at Penn's Landing worth of this great space. Once the nearly fifty foot concrete skeletal stfucture is torn down, this promising icon - worth of a world of tourists - will be lost forever. Don't let it happen.
  Add your voice, your art, your texting fingers, your joy at seeing this great arch welcome you to Penn's Landing, even as it welcomes you now. For this memorial arch is long overdue; think of the Gateway in St. Louis, or even the Statue of Liberty in New York. Let us honor the dead as we create this lasting tribute and invest in the future of our great Delaware River waterfront.
