proposal_transcription: The building is very sculptural, and if painted in glowing,
  Sarah McEneaney colors; which could be chosen to have different effect at night.
  under lighting, could be a gateway to the city. Why? Because when you come down
  off the Ben Franklin Bridge + continue on the Expressway, you go down into a little
  dip, then up, and the building leaps up in front of you! Not a static work of art!
  (I am working on getting McEneaney and others to get behind this project).
