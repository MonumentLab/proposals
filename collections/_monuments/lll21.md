proposal_transcription: 'Use the outstretched hand on that statue to proclaim relevant
  messages to the communities he once helped to oppress - re: voter registration,
  police brutality, empowerment of people of color.  Use that unpopular, unsightly
  statue to educate, to provoke, and to represent the duality of the city that was
  once Rizzo''s and is MOVING AHEAD and beyond that.  (More powerful than removing
  him is to use him to proclaim new messages!)'
