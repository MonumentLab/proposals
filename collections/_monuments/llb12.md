proposal_transcription: My wife suffered from Parkinson's Disease. One of my best
  friends was born with cerebral palsy. Another was damaged by polio. All of them
  demonstrated uncommon valor. Such individual acts of bravery require public recognition
  just as much as military heroes. And it is overdue.
