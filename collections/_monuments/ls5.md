proposal_transcription: 'A monument could simply be a seated area with a built-in
  sculpture or in area with various seating, exclusively lit in evenings. Something
  erected to resemble a totem pole or suggesting the multinational backgrounds there
  are in Philadelphia, ex: immigrants, tribes, etc. Hope to give insight with this!
  Good luck!'
