proposal_transcription: This monument could be named as women in urban design maybe.
  Recently we've seen more female landscape architects/ urban designers making a difference,
  but the big names in the field are still largely men. the river trail project is
  a great one resulting from recent movement to make urban space more green, sustainable,
  and accessible. And I think such a place deserves to have a monument for women urban
  designers. I see it as quotes from the 21st century female urban designers inscribed
  into the curb along the river. It's unassuming in a way that people may not notice,
  but people strolling along it would be fun to read.
