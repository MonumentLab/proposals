proposal_transcription: Some type of interactive monument that can be a tribute to
  the different languages that the people of Philly use (signed or spoken - hence
  the quotations on //voices//) and expresses what these languages mean to them. In
  these times of xenophobia and disrespect for //other//, a reminder that speaking/using
  a diff. language is a part of culture/community, not something to be frowned upon,
  is greatly needed. Not sure how this would be manifested, but an idea!
