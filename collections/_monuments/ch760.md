proposal_transcription: My monument is all about the individual strands that are woven
  together to comprise the city of Philadelphia. Members of the community are invited
  to choose a strand of fabric (or, from a selection of mixed media //stands// that
  can be woven) from the basket and weave it into the monument. Thousands of strands,
  of all different colors, weights, media, textures, etc. will collectively comprise
  a giant woven blanket representing our collective city & its people. this can then
  be framed + put in a public space forever more. Materials could also be sourced
  from the community. upcycled from found objects in the city, etc.
