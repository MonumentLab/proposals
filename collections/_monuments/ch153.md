proposal_transcription: Too much time and money is spent on statues and monuments.
  The same resources could be spent to resolve more important issues. homelessness,
  the trash this city in covered in, instead of putting up a monument that will eventually
  offend some pretentious group of people - use the same resources to clean and maintain
  the city parks. because sooner or later someone will object - no matter what. and
  some elected official will //bandstand// the issue to curry favor and votes. no
  more monuments. make a clean city the monument.
