proposal_transcription: A monument that would show how many races and religions are
  here, and how they are living well together. I have seen and heard people and languages
  from all over the world while I have been here. They are enjoying the history the
  architecture and the culinary arts that are so abundant. Many nations have come
  to live in this city and many are working to make it great.
