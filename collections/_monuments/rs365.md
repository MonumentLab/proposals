  1. Create online templates for people to create their own digital monuments: visual & name. Then place on digital outdoor billboards with your #MonumentLab hashtag. This will populate the city digital assets with ideas & spark conversation.

  2. Create physical alternative sites near controversial figure monuments that allow for an alternative and deeper conversation about that historical figure.
