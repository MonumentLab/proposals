proposal_transcription: A small intimate since. The outside looks counter intuitive
  to inside. It's structured like an egg though. Inside is a set of two chairs and
  soft light to glow on the faces if those who sit in them. They must answer a question
  on the wall by telling each other a story about themselves/their life. The point
  is to learn about something through the life of a stranger.
