proposal_transcription: Commemorate & celebrate Philadelphia's version of the NYC
  High Line Rail Park. Phase one is being built now, so a monument can be put in any
  time. I would celebrate the railroads that made Philly so great in the past How
  about actual rail tracks & toy sized trains that take kids on a short ride around?
