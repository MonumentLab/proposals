proposal_transcription: Glass cases along the Schuylkill.  Once a year a new cased
  is filled with water straight from the rivers; a time capsule of water quality in
  a city aiming to improve.  The last/first case will be in an aquarium with local
  fish and plants  fed with water straight from the river - a window into the rivers
  and a living call for accountability
