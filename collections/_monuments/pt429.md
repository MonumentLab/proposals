  Goal - I would like to see African American, Hispanic, Asian + European people depicted optimistically in murals in my neighborhood. I live at Franklin + Diamond. We have murals in North Phila that have people who appear sad, stressed and unhappy.

  I look forward to happier people in Phila murals.

  Thank you.
