proposal_transcription: |-
  Not at all final design, but a way to communicate gentrification & commerce gain support while communities are destroyed & disbanded; we turn a blind eye.
  Gear, objects to represent easy lives on gentrifiers. Rotating platform that always keeps the oppressed/the lower classes in towers shadow.
  [Lower class people] crawling on hands & knees just to have time. In the shadow.
  Needs imagery to represent capitalism keeping people in metaphorical hamster wheel.
