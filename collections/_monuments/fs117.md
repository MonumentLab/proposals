proposal_transcription: Philadelphia has a rich history of postsecondary education
  and is filled with highly respected universities and colleges. That should be celebrated.
  I invision a monument with a group of students from all walks of life working at
  a desk, studying with friends, in a cap and gown, and any other student activities.
  Maybe there could even be a student at each Philadelphia university, college, and
  high school.
