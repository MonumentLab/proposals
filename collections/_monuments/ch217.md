proposal_transcription: There are a lot of immigrants here. Some of them speaks good
  English, but some of them can't speak English. It's not easy for them to live here.
  So I herd ELS classes are really helpful. I don't know a lot here so I don't know
  what else to monument. I love Philadelphia. It's new to us but eventually we will
  know here. Thank you. the hudington library has story time every morning 10 AM which
  helps a lot for my kid to learn English. Thank you
