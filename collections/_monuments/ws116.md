  Today I was walking by Independence Hall and saw tons of tourists posing + taking pictures of the building. Next to them was a man, presumably homeless, sleeping - his belongings under the bench. The juxtaposition struck me, though I was unsure what to do about it.
  I think there should be a bench in front of the building, right in the line of sight, of a homeless person sleeping on a bench, cast in metal.
  It needs to interrupt the pictures people are taking, because even though the imagery is already so close, people still don't pay attention.
  What will it take?
