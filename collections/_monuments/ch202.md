proposal_transcription: As an astute cognizant Philadelphian, I think there are too
  many //white// statures permeating Philadelphia. However, I would like to see statures
  of Marian Anderson, Frazier, Cecil B. Moore in the City Hall area. Additionally,
  I would like to see more of these statues in the local communities.
