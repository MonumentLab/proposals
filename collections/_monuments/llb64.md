  A monument should be interactive. It will end up being interactive in the end. Something that shows the wisdom and caring of the elderly, and the spirit and excitedness of the young. The image that comes to mind is of a older woman and child dancing, inviting others to join, with chairs set up in [illegible]/groups, so that strangers can tell stories/ meet each other.
  Or: a mom carrying a laundry basket cuz in the end she is gonna clean the dirty shit in our lives and we should always take a second out of our day to think of her.
