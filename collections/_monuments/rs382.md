  or a clock made of brick to represent the changes in the city overtime. Each brick
  represents a neighborhood. Materials are interspersed representing materials made
  in the vicinity by Philadelphians. The monument represents the many stories of all
  Philadelphians, not just one person. It is the flavor of the neighborhoods that
  make this city special//"
