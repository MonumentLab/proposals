proposal_transcription: Picture of many arms coming out of a base.  The base looks
  like the side of a Swiss army knife and is titled //MAKE// and each hand was holding
  another tool.  All genders and races are represented with the arms.  A monument
  to those Philadelphians proudly carrying on their heritage. Designing, creating,
  and working with their hands that stretches back to Philly's industrial past, and
  also to its greatest visionaries such as Ben Franklin.
