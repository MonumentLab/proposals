proposal_transcription: Have a lot of lego blocks (different shapes) with a half made
  structure (whether is be house ... ) and just have a sign that asks people do finish
  it, one person moving one block do whatever they want on the building and then seeing
  what it made. It sort of gets at a collective work, that to build anything you need
  to work together.
