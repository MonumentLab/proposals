proposal_transcription: A meaningful monument about the MOVE debacle that took place
  in 1985 - attempting to show more than one side of the conflict. Like the holocaust
  in Germany, Philadelphians need to own what happened on Osage Ave; Police, Firefighters,
  City Govt and the People. It could be a conversation starter + guide for conflict
  resolution.
