  A monument that would represent what happened in the Independence Hall when Declaration and Constitution were signed. People with different opinions came together, listened to each other, compromised which led them to sign the two most important documents in the U.S. history that keep shaping the U.S. as it is today.
  Current U.S. government needs to learn to listen to different sides and compromise.
