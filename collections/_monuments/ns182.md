  In the 1880s, The Mill Creek (which drained over bay of West Philadelphia, was buried in a sewer and roads + house were built on top of the buried valley bottom / floodplain. Over the years, the sewer caved in and streets and houses fell in. Vacant lots now mark the place of these events.

  A sound installation and an open lot above the mill creek sewer, where you can hear the water rushing 20+ feet below in the sewer, which now carries both rainfall + sanitary sewage. The installation takes a recording from the sewer below via manhole at the intersection. The installation is accompanied by a map of the buried floodplain, from S.43 before Clark Park to Montgomery S.
