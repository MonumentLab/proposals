proposal_transcription: Piggybacking on what //If They Should Ask// is doing - I love
  that Sarah Mapps Douglass is named on the pedestal - We have no image of her (that
  I know of) but it would be cool to have her mineral cabinet (which she curated for
  the African American girls school she ran in the 1830s) as a monument, to teach
  about abolition, women in science, gender, etc. - she is an amazing historical figure
  involved in so many interesting Philadelphia activities and orgs - the Female Literary
  Society, PFASS, Gilbert Lyceum, etc. -  more people should learn about her - and
  I think there is a real opportunity to use her life as a gateway for engaging in
  all kinds of pedagogical lessons.
