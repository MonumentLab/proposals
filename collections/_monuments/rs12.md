  A monument that depicts the transgender symbol or something among those lines to show equality for the trans community as they continue to fight for equality. I fee; that is especially needed in a time such as this where they are continuously being neglected rights.
  -Even so much as a plaque with the trans symbol, maybe saying the words //HUMAN// or the quote //We are Powerful because we have survived// - Audre Lorde
