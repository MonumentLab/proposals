proposal_transcription: A wall that is Chalkboard on one side where you can write
  or draw anything.  On the other side is a painting or drawing of Philly.  The chalkboard
  gets erased every month right after being photographed for memory.  Chalk can be
  a box dispenser that costs a small fee to use one (such as 25 cents).  They are
  welcome to bring their own chalk.  This is a way to interact with the community
  and see their views, and ideas.  This is a form of freedom of speech.
