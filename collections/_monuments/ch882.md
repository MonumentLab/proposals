  Fig 1+2 can be made of any material so long as they stand together.
  Fig 1 is the shadow of fig 2. It holds a red cape to represent its heroic qualities. The size of fig 1 is also a representations of the impact fig 2 has made for its community through volunteer service. Fig 1 is a shadow because of fig 2's more operating in the background and not well known by the community.
  Fig 2 is the actual volunteer, a representation of national service members, police, EMTs, firefighters and military who give their time to help those in need. The //A// symbol is a symbol of a volunteer program dedicated to national service and poverty alleviation. The form of both figs is gender neutral to demonstrate no one is limited to service.
