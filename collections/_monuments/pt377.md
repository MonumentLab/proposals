  Philly is a city of Dead End intersections/Alleys.  In windows in the center of the //T.// put mirror - something looks like 2 way mirror - reflective - you look at yourself in mirror (cause you always do...) and it activates video of portraits that pop up - including past movements, Rizzo, Random philadelphians - famous philadelphians - good + bad.  Image fades + you see yourself. Not judging those in past + present - yet asking who do you want to be for our city.

  (Where are we going? )
