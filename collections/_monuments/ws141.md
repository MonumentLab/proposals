proposal_transcription: A monument to Benjamin Lay.  He was a Quaker philanthropist
  and abolitionist who lived in Abington, near Philadelphia.  He published over 200
  pamphlets protesting about, eg. slavery, capital punishment, the prison system.  He
  grew his own food and made his own clothes.  He was barely over 4 feet tall and
  was a hunchback, so would make a striking statue!
