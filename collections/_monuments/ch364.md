  People come to public spaces to be private.
  Create something to cross paths more often.
  Bring the people together, I was out taking photos of people today and its awkward, but what if it doesn't have to be? Why can't we pose for a stranger with a camera?. bring strangers close for just a second and it changes the course of both of their days.
