proposal_transcription: The monument would have ppl of different sizes, shapes, and
  olors holding hands b/c in this time where everyone is split and all this shit is
  going on, we need a monument to show that the US was born by uniting together. We
  all should be given the same rights no matter what race or how one looks b/c we're
  all residents of the US.
