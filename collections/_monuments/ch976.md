proposal_transcription: Like Sharon Hayes' sculpture recognizing Philadelphia's historical
  women, there should be more monuments recognizing the contributions of minority
  groups whos achievements have been historically underscored and repressed.  A start
  could be recognizing figures in the Asian-American community, and the location of
  this first site could be Chinatown.
