proposal_transcription: Please do not destroy these two monuments.  They are a wonderful
  representation of humanity with an eye to the future.  If they can't be stored at
  the University of Pennsylvania, perhaps they could be placed somewhere in the city
  of Philadelphia.  It might be nice to have them exhibited in a Philadelphia museum
  alone or as part of another exhibit and made accessible to high school and middle
  school children. Teachers
