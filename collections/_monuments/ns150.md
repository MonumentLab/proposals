  I think we should have a miral at different locations of Phila who lives had been gone due to violence. that includes murders, suicides, death by motor vehicle. let people know that alot of people are losing their lives due to nonsense. Hopefully the people will understand it makes no sence to kill someone due to revenge.
  people should know that there are better solutions instead of shooting, killing, ect.
