  According to Sharon Hays' If They Should Ask, there are only two sculptures dedicated to women out of the hundreds in Philadelphia.  Obviously, way more than two women have made an artistic, cultural, or historical influence on the city, so this disparity in representation must be rectified.  Perhaps a starting point could be a sculpture garden.  Each sculpture could be of an influential woman, or a woman (of Philadelphia) that the artist finds inspiring.  A collaborative project.

  (Like this, but with way more statues)

  Standing shoulder - to shoulder to represent solidarity and unity

  facing outwards to represent the womens' outward influence on Philadelphia.
