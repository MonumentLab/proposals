proposal_transcription: I'm not much knowledgeable about certain monuments that deserve
  to commerate a person, or event's legacy, but if I would, it would have to for something,
  or someone that represents good change, diversity, true justice, perserverance,
  reality, history set in stone, equality, unity, and/or true freedom with not a single
  flaw of known corruption. Otherwise, it would be by instant, or longer first impression,
  a waste of money.
