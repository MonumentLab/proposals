proposal_transcription: The monument I believe or that is in my head is of various
  people from ALL walks of life. Such as a man in a suit, a man in a uniform, a police
  officer, a homeless man, a mother holding a baby and a child. They all should be
  holding hands kind of in a semi circle with the saying No matter where you live
  in life and no mater where you've been you matter. We are Philadelphia.
