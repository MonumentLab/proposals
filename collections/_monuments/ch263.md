  The city of Philadelphia is our nations largest/ single neighborhood, unified by Love, concerns + synergy ...
  I think an //active-monument// showing ALL sides of our city should be viewed, expressing a living, growing event of people + places of hope.
  It's The People, not the buildings that made the structures we can/do thrive within.
