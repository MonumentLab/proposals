proposal_transcription: I see this current monument, to //me// and it seems to be
  an exercise in the narcissism and celebrity culture that has overtaken American
  cultures and has allowed for a celebrity to become president. My own monument would
  not be of one person, but multiple people in a friendly embrace. We see to often
  monuments to the individual, but rarely the collective.
