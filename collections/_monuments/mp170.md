  The city of Philadelphia has been described as a city that is walkable.  It is also a city that has centuries & layers of street beneath it.  A giant //quilt// with panels that rep different forms of pavement around the city would represent both the current & past residents of the city of Love. (These are ideas, but others may have better streets)

  steel border
  gayborhood crosswalks
  Rocky steps
  Hole on Vine St Walkway
  Center city cross walk nubs
  bike lane on parkway
  garbage (be real)
  Elfreths Alley
  Brick under mackadum (sp?) ppothole
  new 40s paved
  1970 concrete
