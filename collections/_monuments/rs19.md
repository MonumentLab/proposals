proposal_transcription: a statue honoring Philadelphia's incredible musicians and
  vocalists. I'm patichurly fond of Patti LaBelle, Marian Anderson, and Billie Holiday.
  I'd like to see portraits of these amazing sisters where they might perform today,
  outside the kimmel or sazane Roberts theater.
