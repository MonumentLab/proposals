proposal_transcription: |-
  Collection of bricks/pavers/cobblestones from all parts of Philadelphia/surrounding areas to pave one whole street in Center City.  It's meant to highlight Philly's diverse neighborhoods + extensive history, but also to show how Philadelphia is always creating new things/moving forward because of that history

  Can also be critical since there are a lot of neighborhood that don't get the same attention as say, old city, so they could have missing stones to highlight that?
