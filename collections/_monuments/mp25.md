proposal_transcription: My idea for a monument would be the giant dollar placed in
  the middle of city hall courtyard. This is because America is all about being the
  free country bath physically, lawfully and financially. First, you would make a
  rectangle shape, make the dollar green. In the middle, you would carve different
  people out of the face of the president that found freedom in America.
