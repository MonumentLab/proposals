proposal_transcription: Each neighborhood, guided by arhats, constructs its own vision
  of bamboo shoots. Bamboo is connected under the earth by its root system. Each neighborhood
  will have its own thriving bamboo plant, knowing under the concrete + asphalt there
  is physical Earth those roots she connected through. This connection is reminded
  back to us through the beauty of the plants we visit in our own and in the neighborhoods
  of our neighbors + friends. This reminds us that in Philadelphia those concrete
  building + asphalt streets we build serve us, as they dwell upon this root system;
  connecting the neighborhoods + making room for the bamboo to thrive in our neighborhoods.
