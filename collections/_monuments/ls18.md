proposal_transcription: In my opinion nature is where we came from; who we are. Are
  bodies are made from nature, so why not create natural nature monuments; not just
  in the heart of Philly but all over Philadelphia! Maybe planting tress of a certain
  kind in north Philly, than in west Philly a different kind of tree, and the same
  for south until we have different types of trees all over Philly!
