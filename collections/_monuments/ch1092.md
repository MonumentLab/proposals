proposal_transcription: George Sig Porter is my brother and he was murdered in the
  biggest killing called the Lex St. Massacre.  It is not only appropriate for a monument
  but during these moments like the holidays. For 17 years has been fueling pressure
  for not only me but other families and a whole community.  Iâ€™m requesting for the
  City of Philadelphia to declare December 28th as a day of Peace.  If this show they
  care, maybe it can slow down the murders across the city of Philadelphia.
