  I work in a school in Somerton, and it's easy to feel like the city limits of Philly don't expand to these parts, which tend to be immigrant, low-income communities. A monument celebrating the expansiveness of Philadelphia would remind these communities that this city is just as much theirs, to grow + thrive in.
