proposal_transcription: Replace William Penn at the top of City Hall with the statue
  of Rocky Balboa currently outside of the PMA. On one hand, most Philadelphians more
  strongly identify with the struggles of Rocky, a disadvantaged underdog, than William
  Penn, a colonist. Also, it is a commentary on just how committed to media our society
  is, embracing the absurd fact that one of the most famous Philadelphian is a fictional
  character.
