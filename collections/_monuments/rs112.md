proposal_transcription: |-
  I'd like to see monuments of people who have contributed to their communities but may not have been known outside of them - or in any case widely known (like the new statue near city hall)
  A stone bench is a great idea, with inscription
  An image: etched into stone with the story of the individual
  *Throughout the city are such names on signsnear center streets or houses
