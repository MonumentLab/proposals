  Monuments traditionally honor people - (usually white men) of privelage + wealth. Some of these are undoubtedly deserved. However since Wm Penn landed on the Delaware - most of the other people - women, people of color anyone outside the elite have been ignored ... People who work everyday contributing to civic life in their own way = who have LITERALLY built Philadelphia.
