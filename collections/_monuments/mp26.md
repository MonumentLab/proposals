proposal_transcription: After you build the statue, put little holes maybe next to
  the carved face. Make the face colorful like a real human. The holes would form
  a bench for kids. Interactive and adults to sit on while interacting buttons with
  the face. It's like they can hang out there on the statue. Also make water jets
  to shoot water in the summertime.
