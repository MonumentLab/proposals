  clarifying points:
  this is a slide hidden by a respectable outer shell of a marble monument (perhaps George Wash. on a horse). as you slide down the slide, the motion reveals something indecent (like his genitals).
  Decency (outside)
  Indecency (inside)
  3 options for downward travel:
  1) linear slide
  2) spiral slide
  3) stripper pole
