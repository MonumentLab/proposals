proposal_transcription: An expression of the history, the culture, & the people of
  Philadelphia. experiences that can form a dialogue & conversation between Philly
  natives & visitors of the discrimination & racial tensions in Philadelphia (similar
  to other communities around the country) that have impacted the present conditions
  (housing policies, lack of employment, race riots, bombings, racial divides in communities,
  poverty, gentrification, etc.). Visitors of the monument can walk in the footsteps
  & see through the eyes of those that have experienced such discrimination. It can
  then express the positives & community like vibes that are seen in the neighborhoods.
  Ending with a desired future look where racial divides don't exist, where communities
  are being revitalized but not gentrified, where everyone can experience access to
  adequate quality living.
