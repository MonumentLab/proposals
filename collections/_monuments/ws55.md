  What better way to create a monument than to give it breath & legs? Each of us who has participated carries memories of what we felt, learned, experienced here.

  Ensure that other cities can follow Philadelphia's lead by taking Monument Lab to other places, and open up their art, their histories, their innovations, and stories and experiences.

  Make this a new standard to combat the alienation from our own worlds.
