proposal_transcription: Ona Judge was one of Martha Washington's slaves. She walked
  out of the President's residence in Philly while George Washington was President.
  The Washingtons made attempts to apprehend her but she was never caught. She lived
  in poverty in New England the rest of her life preferring to live free in poverty
  than live as a salve in comfort.
