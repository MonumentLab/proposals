proposal_transcription: A replica of the Liberty Bell but with tiny people helping
  each other patch the crack. The people would be all ages, races and genders and
  they would represent how everyday Americans have the power to improve this country
  by working together. The bell could also have engravings of famous quotes about
  improving/achieving the ideal America etched on it
