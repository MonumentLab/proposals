proposal_transcription: The Kiss is a 5'8// tall sculpture in PMA that depicts two
  figures embraced in a kiss.  I think it's a very moving, gentle, and comforting
  piece.  I want it to attain more attention.  I wanna make it big, like huge.  And
  I want it to encourage unapologetic comfort and more freedom in openly communicating
  love.
