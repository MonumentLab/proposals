proposal_transcription: Using Driftwood Floating down the Delaware River there should
  be an ever changing monument utilizing the new pieces that Float Down.  Using it
  as a Rorschach (Don't think that's spelled properly) test.  encouraging people to
  write in chalk nearby what they see.  it would be like examining clouds in the sky
  encouraging creativity & freedom of expression.
