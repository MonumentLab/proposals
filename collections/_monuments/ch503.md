proposal_transcription: 'Cities don''t have enough green, enough plants. So I think
  a good monument would be a wild city garden, some sort of urban jungle, literally.
  The plants shouldn''t be exotic, we don''t want to kill our planet any more than
  we already do. But put a lot of trees and greens and flowers could be a natural
  and esthetic way to create art from that basic, you could add an interactive aspect:
  art you can smell, art you can touch (but not take with you), art you can taste,
  even.'
