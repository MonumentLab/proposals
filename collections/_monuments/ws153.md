proposal_transcription: A big flagstone area where Qigong and Taiji classes are held
  for folks to do and to learn. There's a lot of wonderful teachers who could do scheduled
  classes, and the gentle, mellow exercises can be done by tourists, passer-by, and
  office workers without getting sweaty or having to change clothes (Yoga is great,
  but it's harder to do lunchtime yoga)
