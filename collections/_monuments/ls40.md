proposal_transcription: Monument commemorates when there was a vacant lot here to
  walk dogs. At night you could look up and see the sky like a big circle above. Dogs
  could run free here. The lot is so big -- a whole city block. It felt like you could
  see the whole nature of the earth. I think the lot will get developed soon and be
  gone.
