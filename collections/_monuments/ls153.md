  Spiller helped women after the age of 30 to have the appropriate vaccinations while working with the public.  Spiller Initiative gave any CDC removal to keep vaccinations for women to keep a healthy work environment.  A statue of Wanda F. Mills with the Bible in her hand is the Monument Platform.  Her help was so needed that it interferred with customs and protective custody.
