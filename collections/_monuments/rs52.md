proposal_transcription: In 1853, Elizabeth Hutter founded the Northern Home for Friendless
  Children, an early philanthropic social services agency. She spearheaded funding
  in 1853-1854 and raised sufficient $ to erect a large, airy, clean school/home for
  children whose parents were unable to care for them adequately. E Hutter remained
  head of the Executive Committee for the Home until shortly before her death in 1895.
  I propose a monument to her near the school that now occupies the original site
  for the Northern Home.
