  In the 1960's, white residents of Mount Airy made a radical commitment to form a fully integrated community - a successful experiment, which still exists today in Mount Airy's diverse community.
  I would like to see a monument of figures of all races - conglomerated in some way - or maybe forming a park border, hand-in-hand.
  Btw - The Allens Lane Theatre is located in this park - it is where the first play with an integrated cast (Raisin in the Sun) in Philadelphia was performed in the early 1960's. Sidney Poitter came to the opening.
