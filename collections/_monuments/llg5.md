  There are so many fences in philadelphia neighborhoods, and a lot of them are ugly and old. Having a large fence is extremely unwelcoming, but a large fence with a mural on it would brighten up the community instead of being a boring old rusty fence

  mural spray painted on fence so can still see the mural and it's on the fence
